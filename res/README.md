# Tools and tips

Since this is an open source project, I feel the need to share with you the tools I'm using and some useful tips.
I'll take as example the *Practical 2.2*, which summarises all my experience (being it my last video as of the time of writing this).

**Hardware**: *MacBook Pro* (15-inch, Late 2011), *Samsung Galaxy Note Pro* 12.2 (64GB, Late 2015).

**Software**: *Microsoft PowerPoint* 15.24, *LaTeXiT* 2.8.1, *Camtasia* 2.10.6, *Avidemux* 2.6.12 for *Mac* and *ezPDF* 2.6.9.10, *Mobizen* 3.1.1.11 for *Android*.

## Plot

I start by creating the first slide, with title and subtitle, rigorously on **black** background.

Then, I write a mathematical and a coding plot.
This means, on a piece of paper, I do all derivations before hand (which took a day for back-prop) and I type on my keyboard the required coding which I later copy into a (non executable) script for the recording.

It comes the time now for some pretty math.
I start up *LaTeXiT* and write the first terms of the most important formulas, in **white**, with `36 pt`.
Further derivations and explanations are done at recording time, so that the speed of presentation is sustainable.
I use `\bm{}` for my bold math, and `^\top` for transposition.

Show time!

## The math

After converting the `ppt` into a `pdf` and having sent it to my *Note*, I fire up the first software I've ever bought: *ezPDF*.
It's simply a must-have, if you own a *Note*, but I won't wander off right now.
I choose *Page layout* and select *Horizontal scroll*, *No seamless continuous page scroll*, *No page flipping*, *Immersive mode*.
I run *Mobizen* and start recording.
Also on my *Mac* I start recording the audio with *Camtasia*, so that I don't have the sound of the *S pen* writing on the screen and I can also exploit the noise cancellation, particulary helpful when you have faltmates...
I choose the *Brush* tool with a very light pastel palette and start the magic.

### Tips

Anytime I make a mistake, I simply start over (I'll cut away anything and everything in the video editing phase).
If I have to cough, sneeze, burp or xxx, I go on, better out than in.
I'll cut it out later and laugh at it.

## The coding

Back on my *Mac* I can start the coding part.
I pull up the script I made before, send it to *Gist* and load it up on my *Note*.
Then I start the recording with *Camtasia*, 3, 2, 1, action!

### Tips

Same as before, plus: if I have to think (yes, sometimes I need to do that as well), I can press `⌘⇧2` to pause momentarily the recording.
This is particularly helpful when I have to copy some web addresses or bigger chuncks of text.

## The editing

Now that everything has been recorded (it's roughly 2 hours of video), I can start the chopping off (ending up with roughly 1 hour of video) and add effects like: zomming, masking, mouse torch, cartoonish rectagle drawing, text patches.

### Tips

I do apply compression to my audio by choosing *Dynamic Processor* and setting *Compression* to `-14 dB` and leave the other settings unchanged.
I have also to choose the canvas size to `720p HD` and zoom the video accordingly (*need to write zooma factor here*).

## The summary

After having spent 2 hours for recording the videos and 8 hours for editing them, I have a somehow rough idea of what I've been talking all the way though.
It's time to write the *Overview* in my slide, using `typewritter font` and colours for coding element, and record that as well.
Usually it takes 5 minutes of recording and 30 minutes of editing.

And this is pretty much it.
I'll add something else, if it comes to mind.
